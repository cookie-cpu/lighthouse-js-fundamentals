/*
input is two dimensional array
 (an array of arrays), where each sub-array will have two numeric values. 
 For example:
[[1, 2], [2, 3]]

The first will be the value to repeat, 
the second will be the amount of times to repeat that value.

//TODO
init string val
loop through arrays
set first num as factor
print second num as many times as factor
