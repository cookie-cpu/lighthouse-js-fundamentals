/*
Multiplication Table

We will be given a number as our input data. 
This number is the highest value of our multiplication table. 
Our job is to generate a multiplication table for the values from 1 to the provided number.



Create a function named multiplicationTable that receives a number maxValue as input 

and creates a square multiplication table where maxValue is the largest value in the table.

const multiplicationTable = function(maxValue) {
  let arr

};

console.log(multiplicationTable(1));
console.log(multiplicationTable(5));
console.log(multiplicationTable(10));
